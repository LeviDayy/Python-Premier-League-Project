# Python-Premier-League-Project
In this project I use data analysis methods to determine players in the premier league who are either over or under valued based on their transfer market value.
Going into this project I wanted to create my own soccer scout using machine learning as a basis to determine a players value.
The final product is an interactive graph that displays whether a player is currently under, or over valued.
